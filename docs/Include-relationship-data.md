# Include-relationship-data

Many objects allow you to request additional relationship information as an expanded response, by using the include request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests that have related data available to be included and applies to the response of that request only. You can, however, include multiple objects at once by identifying multiple items in the include query parameter separated by a comma.

You'll find information about what includes are allowed on each endpoint description page.

# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome and contributors will be fully credited.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Guidelines

* Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), enforced by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/).
* Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the relevant tests.
* Send a coherent commit history, making sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
* You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
* If you are changing the behavior, or the public api, you may need to update the docs.
* Don't forget to update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), specially if you added new functionality.
* Please remember that we follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

## Procedure

Before filing an issue:

- Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.
